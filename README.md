# NYVRA-Mapping

**A state law enacted in 2022, the NYVRA (New York Election Law section 17-200) strengthens the voting rights of all New Yorkers, including historically marginalized and disenfranchised communities. The law requires the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to play a role in enforcing these rights.** The NYVRA removes barriers and protects fair, open, and equal access to the ballot box for all eligible New Yorkers.

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing and visualizing election data in New York City, with a focus on accessibility and equity as mandated by the NYVRA. The analysis aims to identify potential barriers to voting by examining the proximity of poll sites to public transportation and residential areas, and considering language diversity across neighborhoods.

By examining election accessibility through the lens of transportation, residential proximity, and language diversity, this project seeks to support the goals of the NYVRA in ensuring fair and equal access to the voting process for all New Yorkers.

## Features

- **Data Sources:** 
  - Past 4 U.S. Presidential Election results
  - NYC poll sites
  - NYC subway entrances and exits
  - Residential buildings in NYC
  - Household language data

- **Analyses and Visualizations:**
  - Election results by neighborhood and precinct.
  - Accessibility of poll sites based on distance from subway stations.
  - Accessibility of poll sites relative to residential buildings.
  - Examination of language diversity and its potential impact on accessibility to poll sites.

## How to Run the Code

An `.ipynb` file is provided, which can be uploaded to Google Colab to be run on the cloud, simplifying execution without the need to set up a local environment. To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository.
2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file by selecting **File > Upload Notebook**.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook locally if you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
